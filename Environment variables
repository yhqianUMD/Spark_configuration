1. There are two kinds of environment variables, user environment variables and system environment variables.

2. System variables are shared for all users, but user variables are only for your account/profile.

3. User environment variables take precedence over system environment variables, except for the "PATH". The Path is constructed from the system path, while the User path is appended to the system path.

4. If you do not have access to system environment variables, you cannot override default programs on the system path by using the the user path. Instead, you must use a fully qualified path if you must use a specific version.
e.g., command "C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jre6/bin/java -version" instead of "java -version".

5. os.environ['PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS'] = '--packages graphframes:graphframes:0.8.2-spark3.1-s_2.12' is used to set the user environment variable "PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS".
 But it will be effective only for the current process where it was assigned and it will not change the value permanently.
