The following instructions are used to display the SparkUI of spark deployed in Yarn cluster on Mac.
1. Configure your cluster account using putty, remember your source port in the "Connection->SSH->Tunnels".
2. Open the terminal, connect to your cluster
   -ssh user@cgishdp2.@umd.edu
3. Start a new session for the vncserver
   -vncserver -geometry 1200x800 :2
   Note: the ":2" should be the port you saved (e.g., 5902 for 590X)
4. input "exit" in the terminal
5. input "ssh -L 5901:cgishdp2:5902 user@cgishdp2.umd.edu"
   5901 is the local port you want to display in your local Mac; 5902 is the saved port.
   Note: your terminal for Mac or putty for Windows should be active all the time.
6. Open your VNC viewer, input "localhost:5901"

Notes:
1. error "a vnc server is already running as XX": you can solve this problem by "vncserver -kill :XX"
2. error "the connection was refused by the computer VNC viewer": you should keep you terminal/putty alive.
