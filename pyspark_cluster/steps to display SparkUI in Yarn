The following instructions are used to display the SparkUI of spark deployed in Yarn cluster on Mac.
1. Configure your cluster account using putty, remember your source port in the "Connection->SSH->Tunnels".
2. Open the terminal, connect to your cluster
   -ssh qiany@cgishdp2.umd.edu
3. Start a new session for the vncserver
   -vncserver -geometry 1200x800 :5
   Note: the ":5" should be the port you saved (e.g., 5905 for 590X)
4. Input "exit" in the terminal, or open another terminal. Otherwise, the current terminal will be cluster's terminal
5. In the new terminal of local Mac, input "ssh -L 5901:cgishdp2:5905 qiany@cgishdp2.umd.edu"
   5901 is the local port you want to display in your local Mac; 5905 is the saved port.
   Note: your terminal for Mac or putty for Windows should be active all the time.
6. Open your VNC viewer, input "localhost:5901"
7. In the terminal of VNC viewer, input "xdg-open http://mn3.hdp2.cgis.gshpc.umd.edu:18089/"

If you want to reconnect to the VNC viewer next time
1) Open the terminal of Mac, input "ssh -L 5901:cgishdp2:5905 qiany@cgishdp2.umd.edu"
2) Open your VNC viewer, in the terminal of VNC viewer, input "xdg-open http://mn3.hdp2.cgis.gshpc.umd.edu:18089/"

Notes:
1. error "a vnc server is already running as XX": you can solve this problem by "vncserver -kill :XX", or use other ports
2. error "the connection was refused by the computer VNC viewer": you should keep you terminal/putty alive.
